Working on a flat, clean countertop, knead the dough a few times then shape into a log about the diameter of your fist.

On a lightly floured board, carefully unfold 1 sheet of puff pastry and lay it flat. Cutting parallel to fold lines and using a ruler as a guide, cut pastry sheet into 18 strips, each about 1/2 inch wide. Repeat to unfold and cut other sheet of puff pastry. If you have two ovens and four baking sheets, you will be able to bake all the twists at one time. If you have only one oven, keep the pastry strips you aren't currently working with covered lightly with plastic wrap.\u000aPick up one strip of pastry by the ends. Very gently twist strip, turning the ends in opposite directions. Gently pull twisted strip to lengthen to about 12 inches long. Place twist on an ungreased 10- by 12-inch baking sheet and press ends down onto sheet with fingers. Repeat with remaining strips, placing 9 or 10 twists per baking sheet.\u000aWith a pastry brush, gently brush butter equally over twists. Using your fingers, sprinkle twists equally with parmesan and pepper to taste. Carefully brush off any excess cheese on baking sheet before baking.\u000aBake twists until golden brown and crisp, 10 to 13 minutes. If necessary, rotate baking sheets halfway through baking to ensure even browning. With a spatula, carefully transfer twists to a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature. If making ahead, cool completely, package airtight, and store at room temperature up to 1 day. Reheat before serving by warming on baking sheets in a 350 degrees F oven for 5 minutes.\u000a

Let the husks soak until soft and pliable, about 2 hours. Drain the husks and select 24 pieces, each 5 to 6 inches wide, as wrappers; keep the remainder handy. Cover both the wrappers and the remaining husks with dampened paper towels to keep moist.\u000aLightly toast the chiles on both sides by pressing them against a heated skillet with a spatula for a few seconds. Transfer the chiles to a small bowl, cover with 1 cup of boiling water and soak until soft, about half an hour. In a blender or food processor, puree the chiles with 1/2 cup of their soaking liquid.\u000aIn a medium pot, cover the pork, onion and garlic with water. Add the coarse salt and pepper, and simmer, partly covered, until the pork is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Drain the pork, reserving the broth, and shred the meat with a fork. Add half of the pureed chiles to the meat and stir in enough broth to form a moist, spreadable mixture. Taste the filling and adjust the seasoning.\u000aCombine the masa harina with the baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the 3 1/4 cups of hot water, the lard and the remaining pureed chiles and mix together with a wooden spoon or your hands until a soft, mushy dough forms. (It should be moist but not runny, and it should not stick to your hands.)\u000aUsing a tablespoon dipped in water, spread the masa over the corn-husk wrappers, leaving a 2- to 3-inch border on the tapered (bottom) end of the husks and about 1 inch on the remaining sides. Top the masa with about a tablespoon of filling, leaving a 1/2-inch border of masa all around. Pull the sides of the husk together to seal, then fold up the tapered end and tie the package shut with a thin strip of husk (the top remains open). If the husk is too narrow to close, add another piece to cover the seam.\u000aPour an inch of water into a saucepan, place the collapsible steamer inside and invert the heatproof mug in the center of the steamer. Arrange the tamales around the mug, open end up. Layer the tops of the tamales with the remaining husks, then cover with a lid (trim the tops of the wrappers, if necessary). Bring the water to a simmer and steam the tamales for about 1 1/2 hours, adding more water as necessary, until the husks peel away from the dough.\u000a
